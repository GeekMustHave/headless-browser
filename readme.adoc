A headless browser is a web browser without a graphical user interface.
Headless browsers provide automated control of a web page in an environment similar to popular web browsers, 
but are executed via a command-line interface or using network communication.

I plan to use the headless browser for the Camunda project.

== Bootstrap

There are quite a few headless browser opyions.
After some research I have selected the `puppeteer` package.

Reference: https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer

Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome or Chromium over the DevTools Protocol. 
It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium.

=== Node Initilazion

I not certain if this step  is really needed.
But, I've done it with all the other projects.

  npm Init 

=== Install puppeteer  

In general, the rule of thumb is:

. If you’re installing something that you want to use in your program, 
using require('whatever'), then install it locally, at the root of your project.
. If you’re installing something that you want to use in your shell, 
on the command line or something, install it globally, so that its binaries end up in your PATH environment variable.  

   npm install puppeteer

NOTE:  When you install Puppeteer, 
it downloads a recent version of Chromium 
(~170Mb Mac, ~282Mb Linux, ~280Mb Win) 
that is guaranteed to work with the API. To skip the download   

This added the following to the package.json filre.

----
  "dependencies": {
    "puppeteer": "^1.2.0"
  }

----

== Example code 

The example code is based on the web site example.com.
The example code uses ES6 syntax.

[source,javascript]
----
include::example.js[Code]
----

When this code is run there will be a pause just after the browser object is created.

The Node app will create a file `example.png` which in this case looks like.



== GIT / GITHub 

I'm GitHub'ing everything.

=== .gitignore file

Create this file before you GIT anything.

.`.gitignore` example for this project
----
node_modules <1>
.gitignore
----
<1> You dont need to the `node_modeles` libraries you can recreate


=== Create local GIT

Create GIT repository, add everything (except whats named in the `.gitignore` file), commit it.

----
git init
git add .
git commit -mFirst-One
----

Results are 

[source,powershell]
----

=== Create remote GitHub

Create a new repository on GitHub.

image::github.png[Remote]

Github will give you the commands to sync the local Git to the remote Git.

image::gitremote.png[Transfer]

=== Sync local to remote

----
git remote add origin https://github.com/GeekMustHave/headless-browser.git
git push -u origin master
----

Which results in 
[source,powershell]

PS F:\users\jschust2\Dropbox\myDev\HeadlessBrowser> git remote add origin https://github.com/GeekMustHave/headless-browser.git
PS F:\users\jschust2\Dropbox\myDev\HeadlessBrowser> git push -u origin master

Now the GitHub will be loaded with the project and the `readme.adoc` 
file is used as the documentation for the repository.
